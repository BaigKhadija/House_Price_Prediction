# House_Price_Prediction

This project focused on building a linear regression model to predict house prices based on features such as the number of bedrooms and square footage. 

The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. Various techniques, including feature scaling and normalization, were applied to improve model accuracy. The final linear regression model demonstrated a strong ability to predict house prices, highlighting the importance of key features like the number of bedrooms and overall square footage.
